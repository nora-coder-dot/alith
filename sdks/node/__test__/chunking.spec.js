    ## Features
    
    + **Multiple Model Support**: Support for small models and large language models e.g., Llama, Grok, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.
    + **Highly Extensible**: From covering internal prompts to accessing low-level APIs. Customize roles, goals, tools, actions and behaviors while maintaining a clean abstraction.
    + **Workflow Support**: Implementing any workflow pattern through processes - from simple sequential and hierarchical processes to complex custom orchestration patterns with conditional branching and parallel execution.
    + **Cross-Language Support**: Provides SDKs for Rust, Python and Node.js, making it easily accessible to different developers.
    + **High-Performance Inference**: Leverage the performance advantages of Rust and quick model inference technologies including graph optimization, model compression, JIT/AOT compilation with GPU coprocessors, etc.
    + **Web3 Friendly and Secure**: Out-of-the-box Web3 plugin allows developers to easily and securely integrate blockchain capabilities into TEE-based AI agent frameworks and their applications.
