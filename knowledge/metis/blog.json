Traditional Layer 2 solutions, though an improvement over Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s base layer, still struggle with congestion, centralized sequencers, and limited adaptability for AI-driven workloads.Hyperion (HYPE) is built to break through these limitations. Designed specifically for AI developers, DeFi protocols, and gaming applications, Hyperion is an ultra-fast, AI-optimized Layer 2 blockchain that eliminates the compromises of traditional rollup solutions. It introduces a high-performance modular rollup architecture, providing real-time execution, parallel processing, decentralized sequencing, and seamless Ethereum interoperability. With Hyperion, developers gain access to scalability without trade-offs, ensuring that complex applications perform at Web2-like speeds without sacrificing decentralization or security.Hyperion achieves 1-2 gigagas per second, making it one of the highest-performing Layer 2 solutions that will be available for AI engineers building in Web3.Hyperion vs. Andromeda: A Dual-Chain EcosystemHyperion is not replacing Andromeda, the existing Metis Layer 2 network, but rather expanding Metis' ecosystem with a specialized, high-performance infrastructure. While Andromeda serves as the general-purpose Layer 2 platform for Ethereum dApps, Hyperion introduces a more advanced modular rollup architecture tailored for high-frequency, AI-powered applications. This dual-chain strategy ensures that Metis can support the full spectrum of Web3 applications, offering tailored infrastructure solutions without compromise.Why Hyperion MattersLet's delve into why Hyperion is critical for the future of AI + Web3 applications and how its innovations solve fundamental issues that have long plagued Ethereum Layer 2 solutions.MetisVM: The AI-Optimized Virtual MachineAI applications require substantial computational power, and standard Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs) are not designed to handle the high-performance execution demands of AI models. Hyperion introduces MetisVM, a custom-built virtual machine optimized for on-chain AI inference and high-throughput dApps.How MetisVM accelerates smart contract execution:Dynamic Opcode Optimization: Smart contract execution is enhanced with dynamically optimized opcodes, reducing gas fees and improving efficiency.Speculative & Parallel Execution: AI-powered dApps can predict, precompute, and execute certain actions in parallel, greatly increasing processing speed.State-Aware Caching: Instead of fetching redundant data repeatedly, MetisVM caches frequently accessed information, ensuring faster execution times for AI and high-performance applications.Why it matters: AI developers can now run machine learning models, inference engines, and data-driven smart contracts natively on-chain, something that was previously impossible without off-chain solutions.Instant, Parallelized Transaction Processing: Hyper-ScalabilityTraditional Layer 2 solutions operate using a sequential transaction execution model, creating performance bottlenecks under high demand. Hyperion introduces a Parallel Execution Engine with an Optimistic Rollup model that enables real-time, concurrent transaction processing, a necessity for AI driven, gaming, and high-frequency DeFAI applications.\u00c2\u00a0How Hyperion achieves real-time execution:Optimistic Model: Transactions are initially assumed valid and settled quickly, with fraud-proof mechanisms ensuring network integrity.Parallel Execution Engine: Unlike traditional blockchain architectures, Hyperion allows multiple transactions and smart contracts to execute at the same time, significantly reducing delays and increasing scalability.Optimized Fraud-Proof Mechanisms: Unlike traditional Layer 2 solutions where fraud proofs can slow down execution, Hyperion optimizes fraud-checking processes, making the network both fast and secure.Why it matters: High-performance applications like on-chain AI, decentralized gaming, and real-time trading require sub-second execution times. Hyperion removes performance bottlenecks that have previously hindered Web3 innovation.MetisDB: Breaking the Blockchain Storage BottleneckBlockchain state management is a significant bottleneck for high-performance applications. MetisDB introduces an advanced storage system, enabling instant state access and cost-efficient data management.How MetisDB optimizes storage:Memory-Mapped Merkle Trees: Transactions are verified with near nanosecond-level state access, eliminating delays caused by slow storage retrieval.Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC): Allows simultaneous updates to blockchain state, avoiding bottlenecks in state modifications.Asynchronous I/O Processing: Storage read/write operations are optimized in real time, ensuring transactions complete faster without unnecessary computation delays.Why it matters: AI applications demand high-speed data retrieval and storage efficiency. MetisDB ensures that Web3 AI applications can scale without being slowed down by traditional blockchain state management issues.Ethereum Settlement & Seamless Cross-Chain InteroperabilityHyperion is not an isolated blockchain, it is designed to be deeply integrated with Ethereum and the broader Web3 ecosystem. By leveraging periodic state commitments and cross-chain connectivity, Hyperion ensures that developers can build dApps that interact seamlessly across multiple networks ensuring that assets, liquidity, and data can flow freely across EVM chains.How Hyperion ensures cross-chain functionality:Optimized Ethereum Settlement: Hyperion periodically commits state changes to Ethereum, ensuring Ethereum-level security while maintaining cost efficiency. This means that all transactions on Hyperion ultimately derive security from Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s battle-tested consensus model, providing finality and immutability without excessive fees.Shared Bridge & Multi-Chain Liquidity: Hyperion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shared bridge framework facilitates the movement of assets and liquidity across multiple EVM compatible chains. This enables developers to create cross-chain AI models, gaming economies, and DeFi applications.\u00c2\u00a0Decentralized Data & Compute Aggregation: Hyperion integrates with off-chain compute networks, allowing AI applications to access external processing power while still maintaining the integrity of on-chain execution. AI developers can deploy high-compute inference models on-chain, leveraging distributed compute providers for enhanced scalability.Why it matters: AI and gaming developers need real-time, low-cost, and high-security environments to operate effectively. Hyperion ensures that developers can settle assets securely on Ethereum, move liquidity across multiple chains, and tap into decentralized compute power, creating truly scalable Web3 applications.Resistant, Reliable, and Fair Execution: Decentralized SequencingOne of the most persistent flaws in existing Layer 2 rollups is their reliance on centralized sequencers, which introduce risks of censorship, unfair transaction ordering, and single points of failure. Hyperion eliminates these vulnerabilities by implementing a Decentralized Sequencer Network that ensures resistance, reliability, and fairness in transaction processing.How Hyperion ensures fair execution:Leader Rotation Mechanism: Instead of relying on a single entity, Hyperion rotates sequencers dynamically, ensuring that no one party controls the network or influences transaction ordering.Timeout Failover: If a sequencer node goes offline or fails to validate transactions within a specified timeframe, another sequencer immediately takes over. This eliminates downtime and ensures uninterrupted transaction flow.MEV-Resistant Ordering: By leveraging encrypted mempools and Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS), Hyperion eliminates front-running and ensures transactions are processed in the fairest possible order.Why it matters: Centralized sequencers in existing Layer 2s introduce trust assumptions that go against blockchain core principles. Hyperion ensures transactions remain censorship-resistant, unbiased, and free from manipulation, making it an ideal foundation for AI-driven automation and high-frequency financial applications. Users and developers no longer have to worry about network manipulation or censorship, making Hyperion a truly neutral execution layer.Conclusion: Hyperion - The Unstoppable Force of AI-Powered Blockchain InnovationHyperion is an evolutionary leap forward in Web3-powered AI future technology. It dismantles the traditional barriers of speed, efficiency, and decentralization, crafting an ecosystem where AI developers, DeFi innovators, and game creators can finally build without compromise. With its cutting-edge parallel execution, decentralized sequencing, and Ethereum-level security, Hyperion aims to power Web3\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future with AI.Why Hyperion changes everything:\u00e2\u009c\u0085 1-2 gigagas per second, making it one of the highest-performing Layer 2 solutions available today.\u00e2\u009c\u0085 AI-Native & Gaming-Ready \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Built for AI inference, machine learning, and ultra-fast gaming.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u009c\u0085 Ethereum-Level Security + Cross-Chain Compatibility \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Fully composable with Ethereum and beyond.Hyperion will set the foundation of a new era in AI and blockchain synergy by providing the infrastructure for the most demanding applications of today and the next-gen innovations of tomorrow.

HYPE is a next-generation, high-performance Layer 2 network designed to optimize scalability, decentralization, and real-time transaction efficiency.\u00c2\u00a0Built on the Metis SDK, the core of Metis Hyperion (HYPE) is the high-performance virtual machine MetisVM, which is compatible with Ethereum and provides corresponding infrastructure support for AI applications. It offers unparalleled efficiency and performance for executing smart contracts such as DeFi, onchain gaming, and AI inference.\u00c2\u00a0MetisVM's multi-layered architecture ensures three critical elements: uncompromising security, seamless scalability, and enterprise-grade reliability. Optimizing for traditional smart contracts and AI-specific operations enables MetisVM to create the foundation that powers the Metis Hyperion ecosystem.Hyperion architecture introduces a high-throughput, low-latency architecture representing a fundamental advance in blockchain performance, enabling AI applications and complex DeFi operations that were previously impossible at scale.While Andromeda remains the foundation of Metis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ecosystem, Hyperion (HYPE) brings a modular and adaptable rollup architecture, catering to high-frequency DeFi, gaming, and AI-driven workloads. This marks a significant evolution for Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, delivering unprecedented speed, decentralization, and interoperability.Why Metis Hyperion?Ethereum Layer 2 solutions have improved scalability, but existing rollups still face critical limitations, including centralized sequencers, network congestion, and rigid gas payment models. Hyperion directly addresses these challenges by introducing:Optimistic Rollup & Parallel Execution: Real-time transaction processing and near-instant finality.Decentralized Sequencer Network: A fair, scalable, and censorship-resistant system that optimizes AI workloads.Ethereum Settlement & Cross-Chain Interoperability: Ensuring seamless liquidity movement and compatibility with Ethereum and other blockchains.Hyperion's specialized infrastructure enables AI applications to achieve performance previously impossible on blockchain networks.Hyperion is pioneering new possibilities for a Layer 2\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is designed to be the first AI-optimized rollup, enabling AI-native computation, decentralized sequencing, and seamless cross-chain asset movement.Key TechnologyOptimistic Rollup & Parallel ExecutionHyperion integrates parallelized transaction execution with an Optimistic Rollup model, significantly increasing transaction throughput and reducing latency. The execution model employs:Block-STM-based Parallel Execution: Processes multiple transactions simultaneously, eliminating traditional bottlenecks.Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC): Reduces rollback overhead, optimizing execution efficiency.Dynamic DAG Scheduling: Ensures optimal transaction sequencing for AI and high-frequency applications.Hyperion's parallel execution architecture fundamentally transforms the economics of complex smart contract operations, particularly for data-intensive applications. By processing multiple transactions simultaneously through Block-STM and optimistic concurrency control, computing resources are utilized with unprecedented efficiency. This translates directly to lower gas costs for users. Protocols with complex calculations benefit from similar efficiencies.\u00c2\u00a0The system's dynamic DAG scheduling further optimizes resource allocation by intelligently grouping non-conflicting transactions, ensuring maximum throughput while minimizing computational waste. For developers, this cost efficiency opens new possibilities for onchain applications that would be prohibitively expensive on other networks.\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008bDecentralized Sequencer NetworkUnlike traditional rollups that rely on centralized sequencers, Hyperion (HYPE) will move to a fully decentralized sequencer model, distributing sequencing responsibilities dynamically to prevent MEV attacks, censorship, and single points of failure.Leader Rotation Mechanism: Ensures fair, distributed sequencing to prevent monopolization.MEV-Resistant Ordering: Encrypted mempools & Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS) eliminate front-running and unfair advantages.AI Optimization: Dynamically allocates sequencer resources for AI-powered applications.Ethereum Settlement & Cross-Chain InteroperabilityHyperion remains fully secured by Ethereum while offering multi-chain connectivity:Optimized Ethereum Settlement: State commitments to Ethereum for long-term security.Shared Bridge & Cross-Chain Compatibility: Seamlessly connects assets and liquidity across multiple chains.Native Paymaster Support (Coming Soon): Allows gas payments in ETH, USDC, and USDT, lowering entry barriers for mainstream adoption.Hyperion & Andromeda: A Multi-Network FutureMetis Hyperion (HYPE) and Andromeda will coexist within the Metis ecosystem, serving distinct yet complementary roles:Andromeda: Metis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 first and most established Layer 2, optimized for general-purpose decentralized applications (DApps).Hyperion (HYPE): A high-performance, AI-native execution layer prioritizing speed, decentralized sequencing, and AI-driven workloads.This multi-network approach ensures that developers and enterprises have the flexibility to deploy applications tailored to their specific needs, benefiting from Metis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 shared Layer 2 technology.METIS Token Multi-chain UtilityThe METIS token sits at the center of the ecosystem's economic model, capturing value and maintaining utility on both Andromeda and Hyperion networks through multiple mechanisms. As the native gas token for all transactions across both chains, METIS maintains consistent demand regardless of which network users choose.\u00c2\u00a0This dual-network utility creates a unified economic system where transaction volume from AI-intensive applications on Hyperion and general DApps on Andromeda both contribute to token value. This multi-chain approach ensures that as the ecosystem expands, METIS token utility strengthens proportionally across all network activities.Long-term Ecosystem Growth and Value ExpansionMetis' dual-network strategy represents a forward-thinking approach to sustainable ecosystem growth. Rather than forcing all applications onto a one-size-fits-all solution, the complementary nature of Andromeda and Hyperion allows each to specialize while contributing to the whole. This creates natural expansion paths for projects as they evolve - starting with standard DApps on Andromeda and later incorporating AI components through Hyperion.The approach also insulates the ecosystem from market cycles by diversifying use cases across different technological domains. As general DeFi applications provide reliable baseline activity, AI applications drive innovation and new growth frontiers. A balanced, dual-network foundation creates long-term resilience while still enabling cutting-edge development.Hyperion RoadmapHyperion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rollout follows a structured development timeline:Feb - April 2025: Testnet Launch \u00e2\u0080\u0093 High-performance sequencer nodes go live.May - August 2025: Mainnet Launch \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Hyperion introduces its decentralized sequencer network and high-throughput Layer 2 framework.Sept - Dec 2025: Mainnet Upgrade \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Advanced execution optimizations, enabling instant feedback and parallel efficiency.ConclusionMetis Hyperion (HYPE) is redefining AI and Web3 integration, bringing Ethereum a high-performance, AI-optimized Layer 2 that enhances scalability, decentralization, and user experience.

The space has seen major shifts, from the early ICO boom to the rise of NFTs, DAOs, and DeFi. Each wave introduced new layers of utility, drawing attention and capital while laying the foundation for what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next.\u00c2\u00a0Now, another powerful wave is forming: AI. Artificial Intelligence has transcended early expectations and hype cycles, proving its ability to drive real value across almost every domain including Web3. Similar to how DeFi experienced its hype cycle during DeFi Summer, but its core principles and applications have remained foundational. AI follows a similar trajectory: beyond speculation, it delivers real-world utility across industries, streamlining operations, improving decision-making, and unlocking new possibilities for automation.AI's impact isn't limited to a single use case. Whether it's predictive analytics, natural language processing, or decentralized autonomous agents, AI has an application in almost every sector. This broad applicability makes AI a compelling force in Web3, where efficiency, automation, and scalability are crucial.So why is Metis betting on AI? Because there is a clear gap in blockchain infrastructure that is capable of supporting AI-driven applications at scale. AI thrives on data, and blockchain offers a unique opportunity to provide transparent, verifiable, and decentralized data sources. By aligning blockchain with AI, Metis is creating an ecosystem where AI projects can operate more effectively and securely, while also benefiting from the decentralized principles that Web3 offers.Moreover, the timing couldn't be better. With the U.S. easing restrictions on AI and crypto, the regulatory landscape is becoming more favorable. This opens the door for rapid development and adoption. Web3 has been searching for its next big wave, and AI could be the catalyst to bring in mainstream adoption beyond just crypto-native users. Metis recognizes this opportunity and is positioning itself at the forefront of AI-powered blockchain innovation, ensuring AI has everything it needs to scale within Web3.But recognizing the opportunity is not enough. Now, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dive deeper into the \"why.\" Why is Metis taking this bold step?\u00c2\u00a0Our Strategy: Bridging the Gap in AI + CryptoThe intersection of AI and blockchain is still in its infancy, and while many blockchain projects acknowledge AI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s potential, most are missing the mark entirely. Instead of addressing the real infrastructure challenges that AI developers face, they are throwing money at the problem, hoping hype will be enough to carry them forward. This kind of strategy doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just fall short, it creates systemic risk, leading to unsustainable bubbles similar to the 2000 dot-com crash or the speculative DeFi boom of 2021.Where Others Are Falling ShortGrants & Hackathons \u00e2\u0086\u0092 Many blockchain projects are resorting to grants and hackathons, believing that a burst of developer activity will lead to meaningful AI adoption. But this is just temporary engagement, without long-term infrastructure, these projects have nowhere to go after the funding runs dry. What happens when the incentives end? The builders leave, and the so-called AI revolution on these chains fizzles out.New AI-Focused Layer 1s \u00e2\u0086\u0092 The most dangerous trend in AI+Crypto is the sudden emergence of AI-focused Layer 1 blockchains. While this may seem like a bold innovation, it is an incredibly high-risk gamble. History has shown that launching a new Layer 1 is difficult, most fail to achieve critical mass, leading to abandoned ecosystems and wasted developer effort. If these AI-specific chains fail, every project built on them is at risk. The foundation crumbles, and the entire ecosystem collapses with it.Minor Token Upgrades \u00e2\u0086\u0092 Adjusting tokenomics to \u00e2\u0080\u009cincentivize AI\u00e2\u0080\u009d without addressing fundamental technical limitations is a band-aid, not a solution. Some networks slap AI-related buzzwords onto governance models, tweak a few incentive mechanisms, and claim they are AI-ready.The result? A chaotic landscape where projects are chasing hype rather than building sustainable AI ecosystems. If this trend continues, a handful of projects may survive, but without fundamental infrastructure, the majority will struggle to gain real adoption.AI developers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need more speculative schemes, they need robust, scalable infrastructure that allows them to deploy real applications. Very few blockchain projects are focusing on the actual computational demands of AI: high-speed processing, decentralized storage, and secure data verification.Metis understands these pitfalls and is taking a fundamentally different approach, one that goes beyond throwing money at the problem. Instead, Metis is focused on providing the infrastructure AI projects actually need to scale. This is where our two-pronged strategy comes into play.Our Commitment: A Two-Pronged ApproachMetis is not just another blockchain chasing the AI hype, we understand the real gaps in the industry, and we are building to address them. AI models are data-intensive, high-speed, and demand real-time computation. Traditional blockchains weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t built for this level of execution. Developers need an environment where their AI applications can actually run without breaking.Our approach is grounded in delivering actual utility for AI builders by focusing on two critical areas:1. Providing Infrastructure AI Developers NeedBuilding AI-native applications is about giving developers the infrastructure they actually need to scale AI on-chain. AI projects require a high-performance execution layer, reliably high throughput, and a seamless developer experience. Without these, AI simply cannot function effectively on blockchain. This is exactly what Metis provides.\u00c2\u00a0High Throughput & Low Latency: AI workloads aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like standard Web3 applications. They require constant iteration, rapid processing, and fast decision-making. Whether it's AI-driven trading, autonomous agents executing contracts, or real-time DeFi optimizations, speed is everything. High transaction finality and low-latency execution are non-negotiable.A Stable, Reliable Network: AI-driven applications rely on consistency. Unlike human users, who can adapt to occasional congestion or high fees, AI models need a predictable and stable execution environment. If AI models experience unpredictable gas fees, downtime, or network congestion, their decision-making becomes flawed.\u00c2\u00a0Infrastructure Beyond Blockchain: AI applications require an ecosystem, not just a chain. For AI to be truly effective in Web3, developers need access to decentralized compute, storage, and indexing services. Without these services, AI developers struggle with fragmented data silos.2. Solving AI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hardest Problems: Data MisalignmentOne of the most pressing issues in AI today is data misalignment, the inability of AI systems to align with human values and intentions due to flawed or incomplete training data. AI models rely on supervisory signals to learn, but these signals are often corrupted or missing, leading to outputs that fail to address real-world needs or ethical considerations. This results in AI-generated misinformation, bias, and hallucinations, issues that degrade trust and limit AI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s usability in high-stakes applications.Metis, through its incubation of LazAI, is directly addressing these issues. By leveraging blockchain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transparency and verifiability, LazAI ensures that AI models can access structured, high-quality, and decentralized data sources. This not only mitigates data misalignment but also provides an open and collaborative ecosystem where AI applications can function with greater trust and reliability.Additionally, AI projects require interoperability and ease of integration with Web3 ecosystems. Metis has developed Alith, a blockchain-native AI agent framework through LazAI, enabling AI-powered applications to seamlessly function across multiple networks. This enhances their usability, adaptability, and real-world applicability, making it easier for AI models to integrate with decentralized finance, governance, and gaming platforms.The Future of AI & MetisThe fusion of AI and blockchain is only just beginning, and the possibilities ahead are vast. The same way DeFi transitioned from a speculative experiment into an essential component of every blockchain, AI will become a native intelligence layer that powers everything from on-chain automation to real-time decision-making and beyond.But here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the key: AI needs a home built for it.For AI to fully integrate into Web3, it requires an environment that matches its computational needs, eliminates friction, and allows it to operate without barriers.\u00c2\u00a0That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly what Metis is enabling.By building an ecosystem designed specifically to support AI, Metis is not just addressing the challenges of today, we are setting the foundation for the innovations of tomorrow. AI thrives when it has the right infrastructure to grow, and with Metis, AI developers are no longer constrained by network limitations, computational inefficiencies, or unreliable data sources.The future is not about forcing AI to adapt to blockchain. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about giving AI the home it deserves, one where it can truly scale, explore, and redefine what is possible in the decentralized world. Metis is leading this charge, ensuring that AI isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just another trend in Web3, but a fundamental force shaping the next era of innovation.Related PostCommunityIntroducing the Metis Business Development Bounty ProgramEcosystemMetis Expands Its Presence in South Korea with a Listing on BithumbFollow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

This initiative is designed to reward loyal community members, enhance user engagement, and solidify the Metis DeFi ecosystem's growth in collaboration with Artemis Finance.As a pivotal part of the Metis Decentralized Sequencer (DSEQ) Reboot program, this plan ensures that 4,000 oMETIS are allocated to Art-Points holders, recognizing their valuable contributions and ongoing support of the Artemis ecosystem.What Are Art-Points?Art-Points represent users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 activity and contributions within the Artemis ecosystem. This innovative points system enables fair and transparent rewards based on engagement and participation. The longer users stay engaged, the higher the rewards they can earn.Art-Points oMETIS Distribution Plan: Timeline and RewardsTo begin earning Art-Points all you need to do is connect your wallet and deposit METIS directly on Artemis. Rewards will be distributed in three specific periods, with only newly earned points during each period being eligible for rewards. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how it works:Period 1: February 29, 2024 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 July 4, 2024Reward Pool: 1,200 oMETISEligibility: Points earned during this period will count toward the rewards for Period 1.Example:If you sold/redeemed all of your artMETIS before July 1, you will not be eligible for Period 2 rewards.If you accumulated 100 points during this period, you will receive rewards based on your contribution to the total points pool.Period 2: July 5, 2024 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 October 4, 2024Reward Pool: 1,200 oMETISEligibility: Only points earned during this period will be eligible for rewards.Example:If you sold/redeemed all of your artMETIS before July 1, you will not accrue new points and therefore will not qualify for Period 2 rewards.If you retained some artMETIS and accumulated 50 points in this period, your rewards will be proportional to those 50 points.Period 3: October 5, 2024 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 January 24, 2025Reward Pool: 1,600 oMETISEligibility: Points earned during this period will count toward Period 3 rewards.Example:If you sold/redeemed all of your artMETIS before October 1, you will not qualify for rewards in this period.If you accrued 50 points during Period 3, you will receive rewards proportional to those 50 points.Please note that Art-Points are not tracked for short-term campaigns, such as the new Nitro Pool in Hercules or the Binance Web3 Wallet campaigns, which offer their own unique rewards. As a result, users participating in these campaigns are not eligible for oMETIS rewards.Why This Matters for Metis and Artemis EcosystemsThe Art-Points oMETIS Distribution Plan is a strategic effort to reward active participation and maintain strong user engagement within the Metis-Artemis ecosystem.

From the outset, we embraced innovation that dared to challenge conventions, setting us apart as an outlier among Layer 2 solutions. This spirit of ingenuity has driven us to take bold steps, face challenges head-on, and stay true to our mission: scaling Ethereum while championing decentralization and groundbreaking innovation.Over time, this commitment has solidified Metis as more than just a network\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a movement. Our novel strategies stem from a deep respect for Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foundational values and an unwavering desire to push the boundaries of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible. Alongside our community, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve created a unique space for collaboration and inclusivity within the Ethereum ecosystem.As we move into 2025, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doubling down on our vision to demonstrate that being different doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean straying from Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ethos - we intend to bolster Ethereum and its Layer 2 viability, and provide solutions through new technology. Through deliberate and thoughtful upgrades, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bridging innovation with tradition, showcasing how a Layer 2 chain can balance forward-thinking technology with Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core principles. At the same time, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fortifying our infrastructure to ensure Metis becomes the most attractive and reliable destination for projects and users.This year is about blending the best of Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cypherpunk origins with the fearless creativity that defines Metis. Together, we will continue to break new ground, strengthening our position as a key contributor to Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future. With collaboration,creativity , and a shared sense of purpose, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building a network that embodies the very essence of innovation, community, and authenticity. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scale new heights, together.1. Quick Recap of Metis ArchitectureMetis is an L2 with optimistic architecture on Ethereum, offering:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Fast and cheap L2 transactions\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Security anchored on Ethereum\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Decentralized sequencers\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Fraud proofs and DA enhancements in early 2025 (Q1)Fraud proofs prevent invalid state from persisting on L2, while data availability ensures enough transaction data is posted to Ethereum so watchers can reconstruct and validate L2 state transitions.With the sequencer layer decentralized, the next step (Q3) is to achieve full EVM equivalence and keep the L2 environment synced with the latest Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) features and upgrades.2. Q1: Fraud Proofs & Data Availability (EIP-4844 Blobs)Fraud proofs are a cornerstone of ensuring the security and integrity of any Layer 2 blockchain. They empower network participants, commonly referred to as watchers, to challenge invalid L2 state roots or transactions. This mechanism ensures that even in the presence of malicious actors, the network remains resilient and trustworthy. The fraud proof process provides a transparent, on-chain method for resolving disputes, making it an essential feature of a decentralized Layer 2 ecosystem.Data Availability (DA) is vital for every Layer 2 blockchain, ensuring transaction and smart contract data remains secure, verifiable, and accessible. It underpins trust, transparency, and seamless interaction within the ecosystem.In April 2022, to reduce transaction costs, Metis transitioned its DA from Ethereum to Memo Labs, making us one of the most affordable L2 networks. This strategic move lowered barriers to adoption and enabled greater scalability.With Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Proto-Danksharding upgrade introducing cost-effective L1 blobs for temporary data storage, the DA landscape has evolved. This advancement allows Metis to align with Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest innovations, enhancing affordability, decentralization, and performance.2.1 Fraud ProofsFraud proofs empower watchers to challenge any invalid L2 state root or transaction. The high-level flow:\u00c2\u00a01. Batch Proposal: A proposer (any sequencer node in the decentralized set) sends a batch of L2 transactions/state roots to Ethereum.\u00c2\u00a02. Challenge Window: A time window (e.g., 7 days) allows watchers to submit fraud proofs if they detect invalid state transitions.\u00c2\u00a03. \u00c2\u00a0Onchain Dispute: The fraud proof contract on L1 replays the disputed transaction(s) to check correctness.\u00c2\u00a04. Slashing & Reversion: If the state is found fraudulent, the batch is reverted, and the malicious proposer is slashed.Impact:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Increases network security\u00e2\u0080\u0094invalid state cannot persist without being challenged.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Distributes trust\u00e2\u0080\u0094anyone can become a watcher and help secure the network.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Aligns Metis with other optimistic rollups that rely on L1-based dispute resolution.Below is a simplified example of a fraud-proof contract:\u00e2\u0080\u008d// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.17;\n\n/**\n * @title FraudProofVerifier\n * @notice Illustrative contract to demonstrate a simplified fraud proof mechanism\n */\ncontract FraudProofVerifier {\n    // Batch index -> state root\n    mapping(uint256 => bytes32) public batchStateRoots;\n\n    // Whether the batch is under dispute\n    mapping(uint256 => bool) public isUnderDispute;\n\n    event StateRootProposed(uint256 indexed batchIndex, bytes32 stateRoot);\n    event FraudProofSubmitted(uint256 indexed batchIndex, address indexed challenger);\n    event BatchInvalidated(uint256 indexed batchIndex);\n\n    function proposeStateRoot(uint256 batchIndex, bytes32 stateRoot) external {\n        require(batchStateRoots[batchIndex] == 0, \"State root already set\");\n        batchStateRoots[batchIndex] = stateRoot;\n        emit StateRootProposed(batchIndex, stateRoot);\n    }\n\n    function submitFraudProof(uint256 batchIndex, bytes calldata proofData) external {\n        require(!isUnderDispute[batchIndex], \"Batch already disputed\");\n\n        // Validate the proof data\u00e2\u0080\u0094replay or merkle-check the L2 transaction\n        bool isFraudulent = _verifyProof(proofData);\n\n        require(isFraudulent, \"No fraud detected\");\n        isUnderDispute[batchIndex] = true;\n        emit FraudProofSubmitted(batchIndex, msg.sender);\n\n        // Invalidate the batch if the proof is valid\n        _invalidateBatch(batchIndex);\n    }\n\n    function _verifyProof(bytes calldata proofData) internal pure returns (bool) {\n        // In a real implementation, you'd decode transactions, check state transitions, etc.\n        // Here, we return true for demonstration\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    function _invalidateBatch(uint256 batchIndex) internal {\n        // For demonstration, revert the batch state root\n        batchStateRoots[batchIndex] = bytes32(0);\n        emit BatchInvalidated(batchIndex);\n    }\n}\n2.2 Data Availability with EIP-4844 \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlobs\u00e2\u0080\u009dEIP-4844 introduces \u00e2\u0080\u009cblob\u00e2\u0080\u009d transactions that store data cheaply and temporarily on Ethereum. This approach reduces L2 fees because data posting to Ethereum mainnet becomes more cost-effective than older calldata methods.How Metis Uses Blobs\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Blob Commitments: The Metis sequencer (now decentralized) bundles L2 user transactions, compresses them, and posts them as blobs.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Verification: The rollup contract on L1 holds a commitment (e.g., KZG polynomial commitment) to the blob data. Anyone can fetch the actual data from the blob to verify correctness if they need to submit a fraud proof.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Reduced Costs: Because blobs are cheaper to post and ephemeral, overall L2 gas costs drop for end users.A conceptual snippet that tracks blob commitments on-chain might look like this:\u00e2\u0080\u008d// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.17;\n\n/**\n * @title DataAvailabilityRegistry\n * @notice Stores commitments (hashes or polynomial commitments) to EIP-4844 blobs\n */\ncontract DataAvailabilityRegistry {\n    // batch index -> blob commitment\n    mapping(uint256 => bytes32) public blobCommitments;\n\n    event BlobCommitted(uint256 indexed batchIndex, bytes32 commitment);\n\n    function storeBlobCommitment(uint256 batchIndex, bytes32 commitment) external {\n        // In practice: verify the caller is an authorized sequencer or aggregator\n        blobCommitments[batchIndex] = commitment;\n        emit BlobCommitted(batchIndex, commitment);\n    }\n\n    function validateBlobData(uint256 batchIndex, bytes memory rawData) public view returns (bool) {\n        // In real usage, you'd do a KZG polynomial check or a Merkle check\n        return keccak256(rawData) == blobCommitments[batchIndex];\n    }\n}\nImpact:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Lower Fees for L2 users, because posting data to L1 is the most expensive part of running an optimistic rollup.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Improved Transparency, as watchers can easily fetch the data from Ethereum for fraud proof purposes.3. Q3: Full EVM Equivalence & Staying Updated with the Latest EVM VersionThe current Metis EVM, as of the time of writing, operates at the Berlin (+PUSH0) version. However, it lags behind Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evolving EVM, which has undergone substantial upgrades in recent years. These upgrades include the London, Paris, Shanghai, Cancun, and the soon-to-be-released Pectra versions, each of which introduces critical improvements that enhance the Ethereum ecosystem.3.1 What Is EVM Equivalence?An EVM-equivalent rollup means the L2 runtime matches Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s EVM specification exactly (or as close to 1:1 as possible) so that:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 All opcodes, gas metering, and execution semantics behave as they do on mainnet.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Developers can use the same tooling (e.g., Hardhat, Truffle, Remix) without modification or custom compilers.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Deploying a contract on Metis works the same way as deploying it on Ethereum, minimizing surprises.\u00c2\u00a0Note: Some older L2s are \u00e2\u0080\u009cEVM-compatible\u00e2\u0080\u009d but not fully \u00e2\u0080\u009cEVM-equivalent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which can cause subtle differences in gas usage, block gas limits, or opcode availability. Metis aims to eliminate these discrepancies in Q3 2025.3.2 Catching Up to the Latest EVM VersionEthereum undergoes frequent upgrades\u00e2\u0080\u0094e.g., Shanghai, Canc\u00c3\u00ban, or future hard forks that might introduce new opcodes or behaviors. Metis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Q3 upgrade is designed to:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Integrate new EVM opcodes introduced on mainnet (e.g., PUSH0 from Shanghai).\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Match Gas Schedules so that on-chain execution cost is consistent with Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cost model.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Adopt Protocol Upgrades so that any features or bug fixes in the main Ethereum client are also reflected on Metis.A trivial example of using the PUSH0 opcode (introduced in Shanghai/Shanghai-like forks) in inline assembly is shown below (Solidity 0.8.20+). This opcode pushes a 0 value to the stack:\u00e2\u0080\u008d// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.20;\n\ncontract ExamplePush0 {\n    uint256 public someValue;\n\n    function usePush0() external {\n        assembly {\n            // push0 places 0 on the stack\n            push0\n            // sstore at slot 0 (someValue) with the top of the stack (which is 0)\n            sstore(someValue.slot, 0)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\u00e2\u0080\u008dOn older EVM implementations that lack PUSH0, this contract would fail to compile or revert at runtime. With Q3\u00e2\u0080\u0099s EVM equivalence update, Metis ensures that the same contract runs identically to Ethereum mainnet.3.3 Benefits & Impact of Full EVM Equivalence\u00c2\u00a01. Developer Experience:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 No special compilers or config.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Off-the-shelf Ethereum libraries (e.g., web3.js, ethers.js) work seamlessly.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Faster onboarding of new devs or migrating existing mainnet projects to Metis.2. Tooling & Debugging:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Tools like Hardhat and Foundry can test and debug using the exact same environment.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Less friction for advanced debugging or performance analysis.3. Easier Cross-Chain Bridges:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Bridging logic can rely on consistent EVM state transitions and proofs.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Fewer edge cases and less custom code to maintain for bridging solutions.4. Rapid Upgrades:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Because Metis stays in sync with Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s upgrades, new features introduced on Ethereum can quickly be adopted on L2.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Future merges, forks, or EIPs won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cause large divergences in the codebase.5. User Adoption:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Decreased confusion for end users about \u00e2\u0080\u009chow is L2 different from L1.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 More reliability, fewer failures when porting dApps over to L2.4. Putting It All Together\u00c2\u00a01. Decentralized Sequencers: Already implemented in Metis to reduce the single point of failure. Anyone meeting the requirements can join the set of sequencers and propose L2 blocks.\u00c2\u00a02. Fraud Proofs (Q1): Provide a robust challenge mechanism on L1, ensuring malicious or incorrect state transitions can be disputed and reverted.\u00c2\u00a03. Data Availability via Ethereum Blobs (Q1): Leveraging EIP-4844 for cheaper, ephemeral data posting, thereby lowering gas fees for L2 transactions and improving accessibility for watchers.\u00c2\u00a04. Full EVM Equivalence (Q3): Updating the entire Metis stack to match Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest EVM version, ensuring 1:1 opcode coverage, gas metering, and developer tooling compatibility.5. Practical Considerations & Migration\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Node Operators: Must upgrade their Metis nodes in Q3 to the new software version that supports the latest EVM changes.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Developers:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Existing contracts should \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but if you rely on newly introduced opcodes (e.g., PUSH0), you can only use them post-upgrade.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Tools like Hardhat or Truffle can be configured with the same compiler version used on mainnet, simplifying the pipeline.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Watchers: Should remain vigilant, especially during the Q3 transition, verifying that the upgraded L2 environment is producing valid state roots.6. ConclusionBy Q3 2025, Metis will have:\u00c2\u00a01. Deployed Fraud Proofs (Q1) and ensured robust dispute resolution on L1.\u00c2\u00a02. Adopted EIP-4844 Blobs (Q1) to lower data posting costs, thereby reducing user gas fees and boosting throughput.\u00c2\u00a03. Fully Aligned with Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s EVM (Q3), guaranteeing EVM equivalence so that developers can deploy, test, and maintain contracts as if they were on mainnet.These milestones reinforce Metis as a performant, decentralized, and user-friendly optimistic rollup. The Q3 focus on full EVM equivalence underscores Metis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commitment to staying on the cutting edge of Ethereum development, ensuring a frictionless developer experience and the highest degree of compatibility with Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evolving ecosystem.\u00e2\u0080\u008dDisclaimer: The details, timelines, and implementation specifics are subject to change based on final Metis team announcements.
